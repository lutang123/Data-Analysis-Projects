# Data Science Projects:

This is a repository for a summary of most of my projects on Science, including Data cleaning, data analyzing and data visualization and machine learning.

There are 11 projects in this repository, each project has its own repository, please click on each project link to see the code and analyzing result in Jupter notebook. 

# Project 1:  Artificial Financial Advisor on Peer-to-Peer lending

Analyzed Peer-to-peer loan risk with millions of loan data from Lending Club and created a machine learning model that can reduce investorâ€™s risk by 14% while still give 8.04% of return.  

Project includes data cleaning, data analyzing and testing with different machine learning models, logistic regression, random forest and neural networks etc.
