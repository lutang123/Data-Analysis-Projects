# Data Science Projects:

This is a repository for a summary of most of my projects on Science, including Data cleaning, data analyzing and data visualization and machine learning.

There are 4 projects in this repository, please click on each project link to see the code and analyzing result in Jupter notebook.


## Project 1:  Artificial Financial Advisor on Peer-to-Peer lending

Analyzed Peer-to-peer loan risk with millions of loan data from Lending Club and created a machine learning model that can reduce investorâ€™s risk by 14% while still give 8.04% of return.  

Project includes data cleaning, data analyzing and testing with different machine learning models, logistic regression, random forest and neural networks etc.
