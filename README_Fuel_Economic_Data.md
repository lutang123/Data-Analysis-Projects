# Analyzing-Fuel-Economy-Data-for-2008-and-2018

This project compares Fuel Economy Data for 2008 and 2018, and analyzes the changes in vehicles and its fuel efficiency.

Fuel Economy Data is provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory.

What is Fuel Economy? Excerpt from Wikipedia page on Fuel Economy in Automobiles:
>- The fuel economy of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle. Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed.

This project will compare Fuel Economy Data for 2008 and 2018, and analyze the changes in vehicles and its fuel efficiency.

The project will answer the following questions:

Q1: Compare the distributions of greenhouse gas score in 2008 and 2018.

Q2: How has the distribution of combined mpg changed from 2008 to 2018?

Q3: Describe the correlation between displacement and combined mpg

Q4: Describe the correlation between greenhouse gas score and combined mpg.

Q5: Are more unique models using alternative sources of fuel? By how much?

Q6: How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy?

Q7: What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they changed over time?

Q8: For all of the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced now, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?
